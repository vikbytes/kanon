    - Implement gradual ramp-up patterns for more realistic load testing

2. Advanced Request Patterns
    - Request Templates: JSON/YAML configuration files for complex test scenarios
    - Sequential Requests: Chain dependent requests with response data extraction
    - Random Data Generation: Dynamic payload generation with faker libraries

3. Enhanced Reporting
    - HTML/JSON Output: Structured output formats for integration
    - Comparison Reports: Compare multiple test runs
    - Custom Metrics: User-defined success criteria and SLA monitoring

4. Protocol Extensions
    - HTTP/2 Support: Enable HTTP/2 testing capabilities
    - WebSocket Testing: Support for WebSocket load testing
    - GraphQL Support: Specialized GraphQL query testing

5. Advanced Configuration
    - Environment Variables: Dynamic configuration with env var substitution
    - Test Scenarios: Multi-step test scenarios with conditions

## Improvements to current features

1. Error Handling & Resilience
    - More detailed error categorization (timeout vs connection vs HTTP errors)
    - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
    - Circuit breaker patterns for failing endpoints

2. cURL Parser Enhancements
    - Support for more cURL options (--compressed, --proxy, --cert)
    - Better handling of complex quoting and escaping
    - Validation and error messages for unsupported cURL features

3. Performance Optimizations
    - Connection pooling and keep-alive support
    - Async I/O improvements for higher throughput
    - Memory optimization for long-running tests

4. Statistics & Metrics
    - Latency Breakdown: DNS, connection, TLS handshake, and response times
    - Error Rate Trends: Time-series error rate tracking
    - Memory Usage: Track memory consumption during tests

5. Usability Improvements
    - Configuration Validation: Pre-flight checks for invalid configurations
    - Interactive Mode: Wizard-style test setup
    - Better Documentation: In-app help and examples
